with st.expander("ðŸ’¡ How the calculation works"):
    st.markdown(r"""
    This calculator uses the core formula for risk management:

    $$
    \text{Position Size (Shares)} = \frac{\text{Account Balance} \times \text{Risk \%}}{\text{Entry Price} - \text{Stop Loss Price}}
    $$

    1.  **Risk Amount:** Calculated as `Account Balance * (Risk % / 100)`.
    2.  **Stop Loss Distance:** Calculated as `|Entry Price - Stop Loss Price|`.
    3.  **Position Size:** Calculated as `Risk Amount / Stop Loss Distance`.

    *Note: The calculator automatically handles both long positions (Entry > Stop) and short positions (Entry < Stop) by using the absolute difference for the Stop Loss Distance.*
